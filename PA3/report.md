## Description

## Evaluation



## Discussion Questions

#### Minimax and cutoff test

Vary maximum depth to get a feeling of the speed of the algorithm. Also, have the program print the number of calls it made to minimax as well as the maximum depth.  Record your observations in your document.

Sample output at depth 1, 2, 3


#### Evaluation Function
Describe the evaluation function used and vary the allowed depth, and discuss in your document the results.

#### Alpha-beta
Discussion question: Record your observations on move-reordering in your document.

#### Iterative deepending
Discussion question: Verify that for some start states, best_move changes (and hopefully improves) as deeper levels are searched. Discuss the observations in your document.
